# Graducation_Project

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based framework for estimating wind fields from Sentinel-1 images. The Sentinel-1 satellite is equipped with a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor that can capture images of the Earth's surface regardless of weather conditions making it an ideal tool for monitoring wind fields over oceans and land. The proposed framework will be based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that takes Sentinel-1 images as input and outputs wind vector fields. The CNN will be trained using a dataset of Sentinel-1 images and corresponding wind vector fields obtained from numerical weather models. The project will involve preprocessing the Sentinel-1 images to remove noise and artifacts as well as extracting relevant features for the CNN to learn. The CNN architecture will be optimized using techniques such as transfer learning and data augmentation to improve its performance. The developed framework will be evaluated using a separate test dataset and its performance will be compared to existing methods for wind field estimation from SAR data. The project will also explore the potential applications of the proposed framework in areas such as weather forecasting oceanography and renewable energy. The code for this project will be made publicly available on GitHub along with the trained models and sample datasets for testing and validation. This project will contribute to the development of advanced techniques for remote sensing-based wind field estimation and has the potential to impact various industries that rely on accurate wind information.
